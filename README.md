## Usage

Randomly select the order in which your scrum stand-ups are run. No more
guessing who give's their status update next. Run the command as many times as
you want, as long as you have the same set of people or items in the list it
will result in the same order for that day. Each day a new random order is
selected. The order of the inputted list doesn't matter.

`daily-sort John Jim Bob Sally Jack`

Result:
```
Random Sort for 99 day of the year
1. Sally
2. John
3. Jim
4. Jack
5. Bob
```

## Install 
`npm install -g daily-sort`
